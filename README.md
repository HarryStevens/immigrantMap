  jQuery and
  Google’s Geochart library (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart).
  
Data was obtained from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website and stored in a JSON file (https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics-2012-legal-permanent-residents).
